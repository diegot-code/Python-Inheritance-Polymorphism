# Inheritance and Polymorphism Examples

This Python code demonstrates the concepts of Inheritance and Polymorphism in three scenarios: Vehicles, Animals, and Weapons.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Inheritance:**
    - Understand the fundamental principles of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
    - Learn how to create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from a base class.
    - Explore the benefits of code reusability and hierarchy in class structures.

2. **Polymorphism:**
    - Grasp the concept of polymorphism and its significance in object-oriented design.
    - Recognize how polymorphism enables treating different classes as instances of the same class.
    - Implement method overriding to customize behavior in derived classes.

## Code Structure

### 1. Inheritance Example (Lines 3-47)

- **Classes:**
  - `Vehicle`: Base class for different vehicles.
  - Subclasses: `Boat`, `Plane`, `Car`.
  - Instances: Illustrative instances.
  - Functionality: Demonstrates attribute and method inheritance.

### 2. Polymorphism Example (Lines 49-87)

- **Classes:**
  - `Animal`: Base class with a generic `eat` method.
  - Subclasses: `Cat`, `Dog`, `Horse`, `Mouse`.
  - Instances: Objects of subclasses.
  - Functionality: Demonstrates polymorphism with overridden methods.

### 3. Polymorphism with Weapons Example (Lines 89-111)

- **Classes:**
  - `Weapon`: Base class for weapons.
  - Subclasses: `Sword`, `Bow`, `Dagger`.
  - Instances: Instances of weapon subclasses.
  - Functionality: Utilizes polymorphism for different weapon attacks.

## Usage

- Uncomment specific lines to test different functionalities within each section.
- Customize or extend the code to explore additional aspects of inheritance and polymorphism.
